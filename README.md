BST (Binary Search Trees) implementation in JS

> The reason binary-search trees are important is that the following operations can be implemented efficiently using a BST:

>
- insert a key value
- determine whether a key value is in the tree
- remove a key value from the tree
- print all of the key values in sorted order
